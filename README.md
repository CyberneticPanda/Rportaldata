As an upcoming 4th year student, I became interest in Canis Lupus Familaris for the one common reason, I myself have dogs. I have always had dogs and chickens, chickens being a family tradition. Whereas for dogs, my street has many names but one of them being "dog street" as it would suggest there were so many dogs which was true. However, the truth was many folks would desert their dogs on my street from new born pups to a large Germans Shepard. So my family made it a tradition to adopt the  dogs and find them new homes whenever people deserted them on the street or fields. At a moment, we had 14 dogs who covered the entire front-yard. So I always grown up with dogs and never had cats.
